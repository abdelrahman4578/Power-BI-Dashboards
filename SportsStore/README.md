# Sports Store Data Analysis

## Overview

The Sports Store Data Analysis project involves cleaning and analyzing data related to a sports store's operations. The data cleaning process was performed in Excel, involving actions such as removing duplicates, changing data types, splitting text into columns, and applying conditional formatting. Subsequently, the cleaned data was imported into SQL Server for exploratory data analysis.

## Data Cleaning

In the initial phase, the dataset underwent meticulous cleaning in Excel to ensure data quality and consistency. The cleaning process included:

- Removing duplicate records to eliminate redundancy.
- Adjusting data types to ensure accurate analysis.
- Splitting text entries into separate columns for improved granularity.
- Utilizing conditional formatting to highlight specific data patterns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

The cleaned dataset was imported into SQL Server for exploratory data analysis. This phase aimed to extract valuable insights from the data to inform business decisions. Key questions answered through analysis include:

- Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Total Revenue, Profit, Number of Orders, and Profit Margin.
- Revenue, Profit, Number of Orders, and Profit Margin for each sport category.
- Number of customer ratings and the average rating.
- Relationship between the number of ratings, revenue, profit, and profit margin.
- Revenue, Profit, and Profit Margin by state.
- Monthly profits over time.

## Creating a Power BI Dashboard

The next step in this project is to create an interactive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard will visualize the insights gained from the data analysis, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and act upon the information.
